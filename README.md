# Big Data Project

## Task Description
- Aim of the project is to use techniques that will reduce the processing time to run a large dataset
- Testing and comparing processing speed of sequential and parallel processing
- Find out the number of processors required to achieve target processing time
- Dealing with common errors found in code such as NaN 
- Perform automated tests where the user can run the set of tests and come back to see results without user intervention

## Note
To run the code, run the main file in the folder called processing

Project files
main.m - file to be run
SequentialProcessing.m
ParallelProcessing.m
TestingErrors.m
